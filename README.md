# Ensemble-Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model
This project involves executing a heart disease prediction model using an ensemble model combining 3 ML algorithms. KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours), SVM (support vector machines) and (NN) neural networks. 
# Project Overview
The project focuses on building a predictive model for heart disease using the University Of California Irvine dataset, which contains 303 individual records. The dataset includes chest pain, sex, and other relevant symptoms. These factors are used to predict heart disease risk, with a specific focus on how high blood sugar levels and other risk factors influence cardiovascular health.
# The Dataset

- *Source*: UCI Heart Disease Dataset
- *Records*: 303 individual records
- *Features*: 15 features, including chest pain, sex, blood sugar levels, and other indicators of cardiovascular health.
